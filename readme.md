## 🎯 Mission Statement

This repository documents my journey of learning **machine learning** and **Rust** simultaneously. Because why learn one challenging thing when you can learn two? 🚀

> *"The best way to learn is by building, and the best way to build is with Rust!"* 🦀

## 🧪 What's Inside

### 🔥 **Burn Framework Features**
- [x] Tensor operations and automatic differentiation
- [x] Module system for neural networks
- [x] GPU acceleration with WGPU backend
- [x] Type-safe ML model definition
- [x] Cross-platform deployment

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Rust (if you haven't already)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-ml.git
cd rust-ml
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Run the Demo
```bash
# Run both implementations and compare results
cargo run

# Or run with detailed output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

### 🧪 Run Tests
```bash
cargo test
```
